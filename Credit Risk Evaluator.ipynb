This makes the ease of use with Logistic Regression more accessible. The magnitude of the number in each feature has an actual meaning whereas categorical features with one hot encoding using Logistic Regression would prove more time consuming in which case we may prefer Random Forests instead. Also, since we are trying to assess the risk level of a given loan, Logistic Regression would make most sense in terms of predicting the probability of a given loan to default."

The test score for the Logistic Regression (0.9925) was only slightly higher than the test score for the Random Forest model (.9918) so the results indicate that both models still performed well regardless of which one did better. Although, the Random Forest model did take quite longer to run than the Logistic Regression model. So, in terms of what may be best for the lending service company to utilize, I would recommend the Logistic Regression model as it will take up less resources and none of the data are categorical in nature."
